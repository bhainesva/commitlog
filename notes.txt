TODO:
backend:
tmp files for coverage files / cleanup or something
more algorithms to generate good test orders
simplify testing flow
run tests in parallel

frontend:
error messages for missing package
loading animations
general styling

Notes:
thought just deleting uncovered lines would be enough but it wasn't because of how the weird { } cases
work.

there is something weird w/ dst
	r := decorator.NewRestorer()
	r.Fprint(fi, ntree)

is good but
	r = decorator.NewRestorer()
	newast, err := r.RestoreFile(newtree)
	fatalIf(err)
	err = printer.Fprint(fi, token.NewFileSet(), newast)
fucks the comments

why do you get null things from the astmap when the input  isn't nil?
