TODO:
general:
error page when job fails

backend:
tmp files for coverage files / cleanup or something
more algorithms to generate good test orders
simplify testing flow
run tests in parallel
make theoretically language independent

frontend:

Notes:
doesn't handle:
if x := funcWithSideEffect(); x {
    // do somethiing
}
we delete the whole block. I think it's fine, in most case having the condition floating
by itself would just be confusing


thought just deleting uncovered lines would be enough but it wasn't because of how the weird { } cases
work.

I don't understand dst
	r := decorator.NewRestorer()
	r.Fprint(fi, ntree)

is good but
	r = decorator.NewRestorer()
	newast, err := r.RestoreFile(newtree)
	fatalIf(err)
	err = printer.Fprint(fi, token.NewFileSet(), newast)
fucks the comments

why do you get null things from the astmap when the input  isn't nil?
